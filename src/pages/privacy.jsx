						<p class="c59"><span class="c1">Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice. </span></p>
