# Get full attribution of LinkedIn sales activities within Salesforce CRM.

Finally, you can fully integrate all of your LinkedIn activities – not just InMails and Notes – to Salesforce CRM.

Imagine that your Salesforce Leads, Contacts, Accounts, and Opportunities all had a timeline showing all of the LinkedIn activity that they took on social media.

This level of integration has never been possible before. Third-party integrators, and the out-of-the-box integration packages don’t even come close.

## Key Integration Benefits

The Aware LinkedIn/Salesforce integration opens up creative revenue operations techniques that have until now only been possible with an enormous amount of data entry work.

Finally, you can show off the results of your LinkedIn program to your board, drive more customer referrals, and run engagement-based demand gen campaigns.

Here’s what you’ll have:

Reporting in LinkedIn

## LinkedIn Activity Reporting in CRM

Easily build a Salesforce dashboard showing how much LinkedIn activity each rep on your team is doing – including direct messages, connections made, comments left, profile views received, and any other relevant activity.

## Full Social Selling Attribution

Shed some light on Dark Social. Begin to understand which of your employees’ LinkedIn presences are driving the most revenue. Go beyond Likes and Comments, and establish attribution at the Opportunity level. See a full interaction timeline of Connections, Post Engagements, and DMs exchanged, interspersed with the traditional log of emails and customer meetings. Understand which of your team’s LinkedIn Posts drove the most leads, to optimize content marketing.

## Job Changes Right In CRM

Easily contact prospects who have changed jobs recently and become a good fit prospect for you at their new role. Because decision makers spend a large percentage of their budget in the first 90 days, this is a fantastic tactic that tends to convert over 3X as well as traditional cold outreach.

## Hyper-Personalized Ads and Call Lists

Pull lists of top prospects that have engaged with a particular Competitor, to customize your outreach messaging. Or, easily build ad audiences that target people who engage with a particular influencer, or who repeatedly engage with your company’s staff, in minutes.

## Customer Referral Amplification System

Find out which of your net-new prospects have a relationship with your top Customers, to drive referrals. Pull call lists of these prospects and hand them to your sales team, to easily name-drop one of your Customers that the prospect has engaged with.

# How It Works

Before setting up the LinkedIn / Salesforce integration, keep the following in mind:

The people on your team whose LinkedIn activities we will be integrating to Salesforce must have an active license of Sales Navigator on their LinkedIn accounts
Your Contact and/or Lead objects must have a Field on them that has the person’s LinkedIn Profile URL. If you don’t have this, talk to us and we can easily enrich your CRM with this data!

9. Run whatever reports you would like, or contact us for examples and templates!
